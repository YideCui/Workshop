## Problem Statement:
According to Amartya Sen’s definition, human development is “a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy.” The fundamental freedom that people should possess is access to food. However, it has been regularly and consecutively stripped away, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. [1] Based on the dataset provided by FAO, Sub-Saharan Africa has a food deficit between 300-500 kilocalories per person per day.[4] It is no doubt that food insecurity becomes an inevitable problem that should be further emphasized for its impact on human development.

The direct harms of food insecurity are health problems, particularly for children. If they lack sufficient amounts of nutrients critical to their growth, malnutrition occurs and would eventually become irreversible stunting. One research uses a multilevel model with random effect to show that in Sub-Saharan Africa, as crop yield declined with the decrease in precipitation, the children will be less healthy. [3] When poverty is considered, it occurs that those middle-poor households will have a significantly higher risk of stunting with higher food insecurity status.[2] Food security is always associated with child malnutrition.

As Clover said in her Food Security in Sub-Saharan Africa, “Planned humanitarian support is not an end in itself.” [1] The inherent of food insecurity is multidimensional, such as poverty, post-harvest loss, climate disasters like drought, and HIV. To assuage food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa, people should find the mechanism of transmission between these inherent and food securities. Also, humanitarian aid should start from solving these internal factors, such as using VIC models for predicting drought. [6]  

Accordingly, we must take measures and do research to help the people in Sub-Saharan Africa take back their freedom of food security and promote human development throughout the world.

In the article, Jenny Clover focuses on the food security problem in sub-Saharan Africa. In her perspective, food accessibility is one of the most significant human rights, but it has been “frequently and spectacularly violated”. This idea of viewing food security as a human right and substantial freedom perfectly conforms to the definition of human development as stated by Amartya Sen, “Development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy.”

Clover utilizes the datasets mainly from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and World Food Program (WFP). Besides directly using data to demonstrate the depth of problem of food security in sub-Saharan Africa, she appeals to linear regression in the statistic model to show the change in undernourished people throughout the world, especially the fraction of those in Africa, which has the highest percentage of undernourished people and has shown the least progress on reducing the prevalence of undernourishment in the last 30 years.

As Sen said in the Development as Freedom, every real unfreedom that hampers human development is interconnected with others. From the passage, Clover analyzes the food security emergency in sub-Saharan Africa in diverse dimensions, including drought and adverse weather patterns and civil conflict, to political-economic crises, HIV/AIDS and poor policy decisions. For instance, the author thinks climate change is one of the most direct factors of food security. By using the dataset from FAO, she predicts that by 2050 an additional 30 million Africans could be affected by famine. Besides, the current food crisis is inextricably deepened by widespread HIV pandemic. From comparing the losing agricultural labor force estimated by the United Nation with the epicenters of the pandemic in Africa, Clover finds that “all dimensions of food security—availability, stability, access, and use of food—are affected where the prevalence of HIV/AIDS is high.”

The author considered the food crisis uprising in Africa a much more complex problem than a mere weather disaster. One kind of unfreedom will be deteriorated by other unfreedoms. According to Clover, “Planned humanitarian support is not an end in itself.” If Africa wants to acquire sustained access to food, the goal should focus on the structural deficiencies of the approaches to food security and be accompanied by competent and enduring responses to different dimensions of unfreedoms. Finding the balance between solving immediate food aid issues in the long run and strategic considerations demands a multifaceted approach integrating political, economic, social and environmental aspects, and this needs the efforts from the whole world.  
  
  
  
### Harms of Food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa:

Annotation:
One of the most direct harms caused by the food insecurity problem in Sub-Saharan Africa is child malnutrition. Mutisya considers food security a human right that needs to be addressed with urgency since it is highly associated with poor nutritional health, especially for children. The article uses statistics models to examine the effect of household food security status and its interaction with household wealth status on under-nutrition among children in Kenya.

In the article, Mutisya sets stunting, which is Height of Age (HFA), as the dependent variable. She searched for immunization of children as well as anthropometric measures for both the child and mother from the dataset mainly provided by Maternal and Child Health (MCH) study (2006–2010). For the independent variable, she computes food security status from the surveys with questions from the Raider framework and categorizes it into three levels: food secure(score of 0), moderate food insecure (score of 1 or 2), and severely food insecure (score of more than 2), which all represented by dummy variables in the model.

By using the Cox regression model, she concludes that the proportion of stunted children increased with food insecurity. After controlling other factors of child under-nutrition like household wealth status and mother's education and parity, the model shows that children from moderately and severely food insecure households were more likely to be stunted than those from food-secure households, with a percentage point decrease of 7 and 12 respectively. Food insecurity leads to the reduction of energy-rich food and nutrients intake, thus changing children's health. Besides, just like Amartya Sen said in his Development as Freedom, "freedom of one type may greatly help in advancing freedom of other types." Mutisya also uses data to investigate whether the wealth index modifies the effect of food security on stunting. Same as she did for the food security level, by utilizing Principal Component Analysis (PCA), she avoids the multidimensional nature of the data and compute them into a single score that could be categorized into three groups: Poorest, middle poor and least poor. Among the middle-poor households, there occurs a significantly higher risk of stunting with higher food insecurity status. Nonetheless, the correlation between food security and stunting is statistically insignificant in the poorest and least deprived group.

Amartya maintains that "food security, poverty, and children's nutritional status are closely intertwined." However, the mechanism of transmission is still not precise, and this is also the scientific question the author seeks to answer in the future. The harms brought by food insecurity are severer and more complex than we thought. Interventions with a holistic approach must be applied in Sub-Saharan Africa to reduce the food insecurity with no delay.

Annotation:
In this article, food availability is described as a kind of human right that threatened by drying trends and the landmass available for crop cultivation. The food shortage will further lead to malnutrition in children in Sub-Saharan Africa. To investigate the significance of food security in human development, the research identifies the relationship between climate variables and the quota of children stunting. The data author uses to analyze is mainly the demographic data from the 2008 Kenya Demographic and Health Survey (KDHS) and climate data interpolated from an association of remotely sensed data, ground-based meteorological stations, and a priori knowledge of climatic patterns within that region.

While relationships between children’s health (indicated by Age Z-Scores, or HAZ) and both geographical and physical variables have been calculated in other studies, this study handles multilevel model with random effect to map out the correlation between temperature, precipitation, and stunting confined to a sample ranging from one to five years of age, which is a relationship that has not been studied previously. Among all the variables, precipitation level has the most significant effect on child stunting. The author uses raster file for mapping the rainfall and correlates it with the HAZ index. Furthermore, she quotes other research to show the causation: “Research examining the main correlates of cultivation has similarly indicated the importance of seasonal precipitation (Grace et al., 2012).” As crop yield declined with the decrease in precipitation, the children in Kenya cannot get access to sufficient food, which results in low HAZ.

As Kenya continues to experience climate changes such as temperature rising and droughts accompanied by continuous population growth, the malnutrition rate in children would inevitably continue to increase. The authors propose that education may help combat the impacts of a drying and warming climate and that investments in improving water-serving framework may reduce the pressure of climate changes on the agricultural landmass.

Annotation:
According to the author, “Severe food insecurity is more strongly related to insufficient quantity of food (energy) and therefore strongly related to undernourishment,” which directly deprive the real human freedom and decelerates human development. Thus, how severe is the status of hunger and undernourishment across the world is the scientific question the authors want to quantify. Based on that purpose, the article searched over ten databases from FAO, WHO, IFPRI, and World Bank to investigate the status of hunger and undernourishment across the world and their inherent factors.

By mapping the depth of the food deficit based on FAO data from 1992 onwards, they conclude that most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa have a food deficit between 300-500 kilocalories per person per day. Also, over 25% of the population in Sub-Saharan Africa is suffering from severe food insecurity. This result can easily match with the results they get about hunger and malnutrition. The global increase in malnutrition level is primarily caused by the increase in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the rates of under-nourished people raised over 2% in the past four years. Accordingly, the most severe childhood stunting problem also occurs in Sub-Saharan Africa, notably Mozambique were 43.1% of children stunt.

However, on the map, they show there are lots of countries with no data available. For example, the dataset of the prevalence of Moderate or Severe Food Insecurity in the Democratic Republic of Congo, which should be included since it is a typical developing country with food shortage. The dataset used in this article is mainly collected by survey and housing census, which may be challenging to apply for those countries with resource-poor-settings. To further conduct the research, scientists may use detailed satellite imagery, geo-positioning tools for field surveys to acquire the data of food security level, HFA, and population.


### Inherent of Food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa:

Annotation:
People lost grains in the pre-harvest, harvest, and post-harvest stages. Most of the researcher focus on the cases of food shortage happened in pre-harvest stages, such as land distribution or civil conflict that deprive people’s access to plant crops. How to mitigate the food loss in the harvest stage, like drought, is also investigated in many scientific articles. However, the scientific question this study focuses on is to re-estimates post-harvest loss (PHL) by the broader use of nationally representative agricultural surveys collected under the Living Standard Measurement Surveys and use reduced-form approach for identifying the drivers of PHL. The geographical reference of all households further enables the data to be combined with the agroecological and geographical characteristics of their habitats.

The results turn out that PHL is estimated at 37 percent in Sub-Saharan Africa while 32 percent across the world. Within Sub-Saharan Africa, on-farm PHL for maize is limited but concentrated. According to the article, “The relatively low incidence of PHL together with the relatively high losses incurred among households reporting PHL highlight the need for proper targeting of PHL interventions” Thus, by conducting causal multivariate analysis of Tanzania 2009 experience, the study discovered that both economic stimulation and climate factors influence the PHL level in Sub-Saharan Africa. The estimation from the reduced form statistic model shows that seasonal price gap, temperatures, and rainfall are the three most significant factors with the lowest standard error. The perception of this reduced form analysis can help find out the crucial drivers of high PHL, which is vital to incorporate in a more thoughtful design of PHL interventions.

The limitation of the study is that the survey cannot include all the regions in Sub-Saharan Africa, mostly where resources are too inadequate to conduct a census. Also, the article focuses on the PHL of maize, which is not enough to conclude the whole picture of PHL across Sub-Saharan Africa. With the involvement of more geospatial data, there will be more capacity to have a more comprehensive estimation of PHL as well as identify the significant factors of it.

Annotation:
Most of the regions in Sub-Saharan Africa rely on rain-fed agriculture, which makes it particularly susceptible to climate disasters, especially drought. Sheffield shares the same perspective with Sen, who believes that different dimensions of human development are intertwined with each other. Just as he said in the study, “When the direct impacts of drought on agriculture and water resources occur over these large space and time scales, there are deleterious effects on food and water security.” To assuage the unfreedom brought by food insecurity in Sub-Saharan Africa, we need to figure out how to prevent the inherent of it, such as climate disasters.

The current approach to forecasting the climate is reliant on statistical regressions, which merely provides a broad-brush view of seasonal rainfall while no detailed information relevant for agricultural adaptation. By combining hydrological modeling, satellite remote sensing, and seasonal climate forecasts, the article uses the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to predict drought seasonally. VIC is a grid-base model to predict land surface hydrological fluxes and states. The model is forced by both the long-term global meteorological forcing dataset of Sheffield et al. and dataset of precipitation from Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and Global Forecast System (GFS).

In the case of Horn of Africa Drought, by calculating the area-averaged soil moisture percentiles and the area in drought, the VIC model predicts the central drought region accurately. When compared to other estimates of the land water cycle, this system shows a larger scale. However, it has notable errors compared to local measurements. Thus, the authors claim that the researchers must have deeper collaboration with local partners to eliminate the limitations by the integration of local knowledge and information about water use.
