## Using Remote Sensing and Machine Learning for improved prediction of Agricultural Land Use throughout Sub-Saharan Africa

### By Michael Cui

## Introduction:
The purpose of this research is to improve upon the use of satellite data to generate more accurate maps and assessment of agricultural land use across countries in Sub-Saharan Africa by training and validating different machine-learning-based models as compared to using traditional census and survey data to create these models. In the past, researchers and policymakers had to rely on ground surveys. This method is expensive and time-consuming, which is less than ideal for larger-scale operations. In this research, through using high-resolution satellite imagery in combination with field data collected from thousands of smallholder plots, new and improved computer models and machine learning methods can be generated to can lower both the cost and time commitment previously needed but increase the accuracy level for understanding yield variation at the field scale across smallholders and further assessing the farm productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa.

This work will build on previous research by Justin Sheffield, Marshall Burke, Romain Frelat, Kwasi Appeaning, Valentine Lebourgeois, Onisimo Mutanga, and their respective teams, and will incorporate new methods to improve the accuracy and efficiency of mapping agricultural productivity in the constant fight to eliminating hunger and ensuring food security once and for all. 【6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11】.

## Human Development Topic:
According to the definition suggested by Amartya Sen, an Indian economist and philosopher, “human development is a process of expanding the real freedoms that people enjoy.” The fundamental freedom that people should possess is access to food. However, it has been regularly and consecutively stripped away around the world recently. Obviously, it means much more than hunger. The negative effect led by food insecurity is holistic. It is more strongly related to an insufficient quantity of energy and therefore strongly related to undernourishment. In 2017, over 820 million people around the world were undernourished. Through mapping the depth of the food deficit based on FAO data, Sub-Saharan Africa remains the region with the highest prevalence of hunger, with the rate increasing from 20.7 percent in 2014 to 23.2 percent in 2017. Most of the country in Sub-Saharan Africa has a food deficit between 300-500 kilocalories per person per day.【4】 Another harm to food insecurity is the stunting and other health problems that happened to African children. According to the research by Mutisya, there occurs a significantly higher risk of stunting with higher food insecurity status among the middle-poor households in Kenya.【2】 It is no doubt that food insecurity becomes an inevitable problem that should be further emphasized for its impact on human development.

As Sen said in the Development as Freedom, every real unfreedom that hampers human development is interconnected with others. Planned humanitarian support is not an end in itself. Therefore, the inherent of food insecurity is multidimensional. For example, crop diseases and pests have the significant potential to affect a wide range of crops and result in significant yield losses.【11】 In Africa, the loss is enormous (up to 51% in 2010) on an already strained production level with poor crop protection practices. Besides, the low off-farm income and poverty are also significant issues leading to food insecurity. 【8】

In addition to Sen’s definition of human development, ZERO HUNGER is the second Sustainable Development Goal. If we want to nourish 821 million people who are hungry today and the additional 2 billion people expected to be undernourished by 2050, more reliable predicting systems on crop yield and profound changes in agriculture are necessary. While progress has been made on food accessibility under SDGs in the past few years, more work should be down on removing this unfreedom to promote human development.

## Human Development Process:
The food insecurity problem in Sub-Saharan Africa is mainly due to natural disasters and poor social context. Thus, to promote human development, government and all the humanitarian organizations should focus on both the inherent.

Most of the regions in Sub-Saharan Africa rely on rain-fed agriculture, which makes it particularly susceptible to climate disasters, especially drought. Its characteristics of a large spatial extent and lengthy duration make it one of the gravest natural disasters. According to the UN, in 2009, droughts account for less than 20% of natural disasters but account for over 80% of the affected population throughout Sub-Saharan Africa. With this concern in mind, the High-level Meeting on National Drought Management Policy (HMNDP), convened by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Secretariat of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), took place in Geneva, in March 2013, aiming to encourage governments to develop and implement national drought management policies consistent with their development objectives. Since the severity and particularly impact and vulnerability of drought vary from country to country, the meeting emphasized the significance of mapping and predicting it. The current approach to forecasting the climate is reliant on statistical regressions, which merely provides a broad-brush view of seasonal rainfall while no detailed information relevant for agricultural adaptation. By combining hydrological modeling, satellite remote sensing, and seasonal climate forecasts, the article uses the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model to predict drought seasonally. VIC is a grid-base model to predict land surface hydrological fluxes and states. The model is forced by both the long-term global meteorological forcing dataset of Sheffield et al. and dataset of precipitation from Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) and Global Forecast System (GFS). Based on the prediction of drought in different regions, the government can implement precautionary measures, such as improving irrigation system, to lower the potential crop loss. 【6】 Another natural disaster government wants to prevent is diseases and pests in crop fields. Accurate and early detection, as well as diagnosis of crop diseases and pests, is the crucial factor in plant production at both farm and local scale. These detections can help decrease the qualitative and quantitative losses in crop production and further eradicate hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the past, the traditional ground-based survey method requires scientists directly detect the disease-causing pathogens, which need high labor cost and produces low efficiency. However, Onisimo Mutanga claims that satellite data can improve the situation. Through applying multispectral datasets like Sentinel 2 and Landsat series data, abundant area crops could be monitored synchronously, and real-time crop information could be obtained. 【11】 With the development of remote sensing and optical technology, African government can monitor the health status of the crops and put forward the corresponding measures.

Besides the agriculture-based interventions, to promote the process of human development, governments in Sub-Saharan Africa should also focus on off-harm activities. According to Romain Frelat and his team, the off-farm income and market access play a significant role in improving food accessibility. Connecting people to urban centers and generating other employment sources will directly affect food security in a manner that boosting production cannot. Based on the cross-sectional farm household characterization data from AFRINT, CGIAR Research Program on Climate Change, and other four projects in countries of Sub-Saharan Africa, Frelat uses the ANN response model to identify the most significant factors of food availability. The results show that the off-farm income is strongly statistically associated with food availability: its importance as a source of energy increased from 12% for the insufficient food available households to 27% for the more than sufficient food- available households. 【8】

The prevention of natural disasters and the stimulation of off-harm activities are the two most significant factors that can efficiently eradicate hunger and positively affect human development in Sub-Saharan Africa. The economy or the human development process we are trying to model is non-linear and complex. Every factor, such as technology, food security, and income level that promotes human development, will interact with each other while evolving. In the past, data is limited. The government can only monitor the agricultural productivity by field survey. When satellite images and other high-tech data sources occur, we enter the Petabyte Age. These new technologies of acquiring data also promote the development of technology of analysis. From statistic regression to the random forest, data science is also evolving with the explosion of data. Thus, now we can use advanced technology to analyzing remote sensing data, which improves the level of food security by prediction and mapping of the natural disaster. It is the co-evolvement of data collection, data analysis, prevention of natural disasters, and food security, which eventually achieve human development. Elimination of hunger in Sub-Saharan Africa needs a holistic approach.

Scaling is also playing a crucial role in the human development process. The level of development varies from country to country, even cities to cities. Thus, scaling is essential. For instance, when researchers measure agricultural productivity based on a country scale, the results might reflect more on the rural area since most of the farmland is located outside the urban area. In contrast, if researchers scale on single cities, they will be able to target urban areas. For instance, Kwasi Appeaning Addo review advances in the use of remote sensing technology and In Situ Methods to develop an integrated monitoring technique for urban farmlands in Accra, which help to form the basis for developing sustainable policies to manage urban farming practices in Accra effectively.【9】 Human development only can be achieved when the diverse scale is taken into account.

## Geospatial Data Science Methods:
Many attempts have been made to use remote sensing to objectively monitor agricultural systems at different scales. However, fields from smallholder farms are typically smaller than the spatial resolution of readily available LSR satellite data. This situation not got better until the launch of the second Sentinel-2B satellite, which will provide significant improvements from existing sensors with an unprecedented combination of spectral (13 bands), spatial (from 10 to 60 m) and temporal (five day) resolutions over a swath of 290 km. 【10】 Even though it increases the resolution level, it has high special variability and the observation will be affected by the cloud coverage, which both challenge the mapping techniques. Thus, machine learning method is especially important at this stage since it can manage a large volume of data and variables to improve the accuracy level. Here, random forest and geographic object-based image analysis (OBIA) will be discussed.

With the increasing spatial resolutions, deriving objects that are made up of several pixels, or segmentation, is significant for image analysis. Object-based image analysis (OBIA) is one of the most effective methods to delineate readily usable objects from imagery. For example, the analysis of spectral and shape characteristics of sub-objects enables land-use classification from images. Land cover monitoring using remotely sensed data requires robust classification methods that allow for the accurate mapping of elaborate land cover and land use categories. Random forest is a powerful learning machine that consists of a large number of individual decision trees that operate as an ensemble. Each tree in the random forest spits out a class prediction, and the class with the most votes becomes our model’s prediction.

In this literature review, both remotely sensed data and survey data are included. Marshall Burke takes the secondary survey data from Innovations for Poverty Action, a research organization active in Sub-Saharan Africa. The field campaigns were conducted in 2014 and 2015 to visit farmers’ fields within the extent of the available satellite imagery. Farmers were randomly selected from One Acre Fund client rosters and were visited twice in each year: two months before harvest and one month after the main maize harvest. During the survey, the enumerators mapped plot boundaries using GPS devices and elicited information on the farmer-estimated plot area, intercropping, input use, and planting date for each mapped plot.【7】

The satellite data used is the high spatial resolution images, or SPOT5 images Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS, acquired from August 2014 to June 2015. Landsat 8 images were pansharpened to obtain a 15m spatial resolution and were then resampled at 10m to fit a SPOT5 10m special resolution. [10] Different kinds of variables, including reflectance, spectral indices, textural indices and ancillary variables, are calculated the time series of 21 images. All these variables build the learning database.【10】

## Discussion:
So far, the research has explored the harms and inherent of the food insecurity problem in Sub-Sahara Africa. Moreover, it also investigated how a single factor like food availability will influence the whole process of human development. The multiple scientific research I have referenced is to evaluate the effectiveness of machine learning and remote sensing data on monitoring agricultural productivity or land use. To promote development, prediction and assessment of the situation are not enough. Thus, one of the gaps I found when completing the literature review is the evaluation of the polices. Since now the agricultural productivity is much easier to estimate by machine learning and random forest, we can set this as a quantitative measure of the effectiveness of policies. From that, we can directly screen out the most efficient policy government should make to increase the crop yields and further eliminate hunger. Thus, the research question will be how can the resulting predictions of agricultural productivity by random forest and Remote Sensing lead to effective policy change to increase the crop yield in Sub-Saharan Africa?
